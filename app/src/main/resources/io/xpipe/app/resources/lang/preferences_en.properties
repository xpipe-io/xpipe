program=Program
customTerminalCommand=Custom terminal command
customTerminalCommandDescription=The command to execute to open the custom terminal with a given command.\n\nXPipe will create a temporary launcher shell script for your terminal to execute. The placeholder string $CMD in the command you supply will be replaced by the actual launcher script when called. Remember to quote your terminal executable path if it contains spaces.

denyTempScriptCreation=Deny temporary script creation
denyTempScriptCreationDescription=To realize some of its functionality, XPipe sometimes creates temporary shell scripts on a target system to allow for an easy execution of simple commands. These do not contain any sensitive information and are just created for implementation purposes.\n\nIf this behavior is disabled, XPipe will not create any temporary files on a remote system. This option is useful in high-security contexts where every file system change is monitored. If this is disabled, some functionality, e.g. shell environments and scripts, will not work as intended.
disableCertutilUse=Disable certutil use on Windows
useLocalFallbackShell=Use local fallback shell
useLocalFallbackShellDescription=Switch to using another local shell to handle local operations. This would be PowerShell on Windows and bourne shell on other systems.\n\nThis option can be used in case the normal local default shell is disabled or broken to some degree. Some features might not work as expected though when this is option is enabled.\n\nRequires a restart to apply.
disableCertutilUseDescription=Due to several shortcomings and bugs in cmd.exe, temporary shell scripts are created with certutil by using it to decode base64 input as cmd.exe breaks on non-ASCII input. XPipe can also use PowerShell for that but this will be slower.\n\nThis disables any use of certutil on Windows systems to realize some functionality and fall back to PowerShell instead. This might please some AVs as some of them block certutil usage.
disableTerminalRemotePasswordPreparation=Disable terminal remote password preparation
disableTerminalRemotePasswordPreparationDescription=In situations where a remote shell connection that goes through multiple intermediate systems should be established in the terminal, there might be a requirement to prepare any required passwords on one of the intermediate systems to allow for an automatic filling of any prompts.\n\nIf you don't want the passwords to ever be transferred to any intermediate system, you can disable this behavior. Any required intermediate password will then be queried in the terminal itself when opened.
