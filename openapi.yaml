  description: |
    The XPipe API provides programmatic access to XPipe’s features.
    You can get started by either using this page as an API reference or alternatively import the OpenAPI definition file into your API client of choice:
    
    <a download href="/openapi.yaml" style="font-size: 20px">OpenAPI .yaml specification</a>
    
    The XPipe application will start up an HTTP server that can be used to send requests.
    Note that this server is HTTP-only for now as it runs only on localhost. HTTPS requests are not accepted.
    
    You can either call the API directly or use one of the following community-made libraries:
    - [https://github.com/coandco/python_xpipe_client](https://github.com/coandco/python_xpipe_client)
    
    To start off with the API, you can query connections based on various filters.
    With the matched connections, you can start remote shell sessions for each one and run arbitrary commands in them.
    You get the command exit code and output as a response, allowing you to adapt your control flow based on command outputs.
    Any kind of passwords and other secrets are automatically provided by XPipe when establishing a shell connection.
    If a required password is not stored and is set to be dynamically prompted, the running XPipe application will ask you to enter any required passwords.
    
    See the authentication handshake below on how to authenticate prior to sending requests.
    For development you can also skip the authentication step by disabling it in the settings menu.

      summary: Establish a new API session
      description: |
        Prior to sending requests to the API, you first have to establish a new API session via the handshake endpoint.
        In the response you will receive a session token that you can use to authenticate during this session.
        
        This is done so that the daemon knows what kind of clients are connected and can manage individual capabilities for clients.
        If your client is running on the same system as the daemon, you can choose the local authentication method to avoid having to deal with API keys.
        If your client does not have file system access, e.g. if it is running remotely, then you have to use an API key.
        
        Note that for development you can also turn off the required authentication in the XPipe settings menu, allowing you to send unauthenticated requests.
