# Security 

Due to its nature, XPipe has to handle a lot of sensitive information. Therefore, the security, integrity, and privacy of your data has topmost priority.

General information about the security approach of the XPipe application can be found on the website at https://xpipe.io/faq#security. If you're interested in security implementation details, you can find them at https://docs.xpipe.io/security.

You can report security vulnerabilities here in a confidential manner. We will get back to you as soon as possible if you do.
