Note: You should not use this build for any kind of normal use yet. It is mostly for internal testing. Once the PTB branch is stable enough for normal usage, this note will be removed.

## MCP server

There is now an MCP server available for XPipe which allows you to perform many actions in an agentic workflow via your favourite MCP client, for example Cursor. The MCP server feature is disabled by default has to be enabled in the MCP settings menu.

## Hetzner cloud

This release introduces support for Hetzner cloud servers via the hcloud CLI tool. You can list all your service automatically and then access them normally as SSH connections. This is the first of hopefully many integrations for cloud providers and will serve as a good experiment.

## Network scan

There is now the option to automatically search the local network for any listening SSH servers and add them automatically as new connections. This also works for remote systems and their networks.

You can find the network scan at New -> Network scan.
