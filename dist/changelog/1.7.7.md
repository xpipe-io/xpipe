## Changes in 1.7.7

- More performance improvements
- Fix file browser navbar commands failing. Since no one has reported this yet,
  I assume that most people don't know that you can run commands and shells if you type them into the file browser navigation bar
- Fix file browser icons being broken since 1.7.4
- Fix connection list updates sometimes not being reflected in file browser connection list
- Fix WSL integration not working when system language was not set to english
  due to missing command-line options in the non-english WSL CLI
- Fix application not working on Windows systems where the system code page did support all characters in username
- Fix exit code not being detected and causing a failure on Windows under certain conditions
- Fix file browser getting stuck in an invalid state when maximum file display limit was reached
- Fix file browser transfer into macOS finder not updating state and causing errors
