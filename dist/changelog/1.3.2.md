## Changes in 1.3.2

- Rework temporary directory handling.
  Temporary scripts will now be created in the user home directory ~/.xpipe/temp instead of the global temp directory
  to fix cases in which permission issues occurred on Linux when trying to clear the shared directory.
- Fix LXD socket access permission issues by checking the actual socket permissions rather than just user groups.
- Fix startup errors due to unrecognized shell type on macOS when Fig was installed
- Fix connection creator dialog not showing an error if it occurred before
  and also throwing errors when a screen reader was active.
- Fix filter text field becoming stuck in a loop and freezing up
- Make docker inspect action more prominent and fix it failing if elevation is needed
- Use cp -a instead of just cp to copy directories in browser
- Many other small miscellaneous fixes and improvements
