## AWS support

You can now connect to your AWS account from within XPipe to connect to compatible systems within it. Currently, EC2 systems and S3 buckets are supported. The integration works on top of the AWS CLI, meaning that it is required to be installed on your system.

The usage of the AWS CLI allows the integration to work very flexibly on any existing CLI setup. You can use any IAM access keys and authentication methods with it.

The EC2 support works as with any other remote system in XPipe. The connections can be established either via SSM or plain SSH. The SSM support allows you to also reach systems that do not have a security group configured to allow external access.

The S3 support is available both for AWS buckets and other external buckets that are compatible with the S3 protocol.

## SSH keys

You can now generate new SSH keys from within XPipe. The keys are generated via the OpenSSH `ssh-keygen` tool, so you can be assured that the keys are generated in a cryptographically secure manner. You can generate keys with this button:

This keygen supports RSA, ED25519, and ED25519 + FIDO2:

Keys of identities can now also be automatically applied to systems, allowing you to perform a quick key rotation when needed:

The process of changing the authentication configuration of a system is not always one simple step. So the dialog is a comprehensive overview of what is needed to apply a certain identity to a remote system, with various quick-action buttons and notes. This gives you still full manual control of what should be done and an overview what is required prior to doing so. XPipe will not automatically modify your system configuration, it is more of a guided workflow.

As adding new authorized identities to systems requires the public key, there is now the functionality to generate and store the public key from any key private key:

## Group vaults

In addition to existing team vaults with multiple users, you can now also set up team group vaults:

They work basically the same as user vaults, only the authentication/unlock workflow differs. Each group has a shared group secret, which can automatically be retrieved in one of multiple ways. This gives organization administrators the ability to control access to connections from a central location without users having to supply any passwords. You can flexibly convert existing team vaults into group vaults if needed.

## SSH jump servers

The jump server / gateway configuration has been reworked to make the configuration more intuitive. You can now control the jump server behaviour right at the gateway field for a connection. When a gateway is set, XPipe now defaults to using it as a jump server unless the option is explicitly disabled, which is a change from the previous version where it was the other way around. The jump server support should be stable enough now to basically work everywhere and work as a default.

## Tags

You can now add tags to connection entries. This allows you to have a more structured workflow when filtering individual connections.
