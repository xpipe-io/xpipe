## Logging support

There is now the option to enable terminal session logging where all inputs and outputs of your terminal sessions are written into session log files. This is implemented via either PowerShell transcripts or the util-linux script command. Any sensitive information you type into the terminal like password prompts are not recorded. You can enable this feature in the settings menu under the new logging category.

This feature is available in the professional plan. It is also available in the community edition for two weeks after this release as a preview so that anyone interested can try it out.
