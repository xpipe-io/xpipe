## Temporary containers

You can now run a temporary docker container using a specified image that will get automatically removed once it is stopped. The container will keep running even if the image does not have any command specified that will run.

This can be useful if you quickly want to set up a certain environment by using a certain container image, e.g. a simple `ubuntu` image. You can then enter the container as normal in XPipe, perform your operations, and stop the container once it's no longer needed. It is then removed automatically.

## macOS tray and dock handling

Due to some confusion, XPipe will no longer use the system tray in macOS as an option when minimizing. It will instead conform to the usual macOS app handling that allows to reopen the window by clicking on the dock icon.
