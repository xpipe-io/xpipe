## Netbird SSH support

You can now connect to devices in your Netbird network via SSH and your locally installed netbird command-line client. This integration supports multiple accounts as well to switch between different profiles.

## SFTP support

There is now support for systems which do only support SFTP and not SSH shell sessions. These can be opened in the file browser as normal, although with limited functionality as there is no way to execute commands on these systems.

## License updates

The license prices have been adjusted by 12% due to the dollar depreciating, which reduced the effective revenue for us as an EU-based company. The licenses are now as expensive as they were 6 months ago for anyone not living in the US.

There is also now a checkout page for chinese users, which supports common chinese payment methods.

Lastly, there are also now bug bounties available, meaning that you can get an XPipe license for free if you open a valid bug report. By default, you can get a free monthly license for each bug you report. I will see how this will work out in practice, and maybe adjust the system a bit if this incentive leads to mostly irrelevant reports.
