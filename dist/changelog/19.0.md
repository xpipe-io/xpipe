## Netbird SSH support

You can now connect to devices in your Netbird network via SSH and your locally installed netbird command-line client. This integration supports multiple accounts as well to switch between different profiles.

## SFTP support

There is now support for systems which do only support pure SFTP and not SSH shell sessions. These can be opened in the file browser as normal, although with limited functionality as there is no way to execute commands on these systems.

## Legacy system support

Up until now, the testing was done on *relatively* up-to-date machines that were not considered EOL. However, in practice, legacy systems are still used. With XPipe 19, the handling of older Unix-based systems has been greatly improved. As long as you can connect to it via SSH somehow, it should work now.

The following things have been implemented to improve legacy system support:
- The unsupported SSH host key / key / MAC dialog will now search for matches that the client supports as well. This is to fix situations in which a server lists crypto algorithms that are so old that a modern SSH clients doesn't even know them anymore
- Fix file listing not working on older/limited versions of `find`
- Fix various SSH timeout options being too aggressive for older versions, resulting in connect timeouts
- Fix tar browser actions not working on older tar versions
- Fix systems where `set -u` was configured breaking xpipe's shell handling
- Fix file transfer failing on systems with non-GNU `dd` to work around missing `fullblock` option
- Fix various commands on systems where `sleep` command did not accept decimals
- Add full recognition for AIX system versions
- Improve non-Linux Unix-based system name formatting

You are running old systems? Then feel free to test how XPipe 19 handles for you, and report anything that doesn't work yet.

## Abstract hosts and direct connections

Up until now, the handling of systems which did not support shell connections has been limited. While you could add a direct VNC / RDP connection to them, it wasn't as refined as with shell-based connections. For those hosts, you can now make use of the improved handling for services and VNC/RDP connections.

Essentially, you can now specify the target address inline or choose an existing host from xpipe. XPipe will then automatically adapt the connection based on what is possible. E.g. if you want to open a web service on a device without shell access, e.g. some embedded device, just specify the hostname and optional gateway. You can then open the website in the browser while also having a nice grouping of various connection entries for an abstract host in case you have more connections added for that host:

You can also quickly convert existing connections entries like services and direct RDP/VNC connections to an abstract host entry to allow for better organization.

## License updates

The license prices have been adjusted by 12% due to the dollar depreciating, which reduced the effective revenue for us as an EU-based company. The licenses are now as expensive as they were 6 months ago for anyone not living in the US.

There is also now a checkout page for chinese users, which supports common chinese payment methods.
