  required was provided failing with the error "Input was closed before end was read" on Windows

  everything else when display scale was set to 150%+ on Windows

## Changes in 1.4.0

- Implement support for SSH tunnels / port forwarding.
  This includes local, remote, and dynamic tunneling.
- Rework file browser transfer pane. Files dropped there will no longer be downloaded automatically.

  to your local machine and can be dragged into your native desktop environment as regular files.
