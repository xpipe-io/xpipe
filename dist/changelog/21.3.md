## Terminal docking

- Restore proper window borders once a terminal is undocked
- Fix terminals randomly undocking
- Fix docked terminals in background sometimes being larger than main window
- The connection hub button will now always hide the terminal when clicked
- Fix file browser docking tabbing being inconsistent
- Fix dock being broken after application window has been hidden once

## Shell detection

Add new experimental heuristic for detecting custom shells of limited/embedded systems. Now, even if XPipe does not know the shell type and can't communicate with it, it will use heuristics to determine whether the shell is responding properly or the connection timeouted.

This should make the process of adding connections to custom systems that don't run a common operating system much easier. 

## MCP

The MCP server integration has been improved. The connection query by name for agents has been improved to reduce ambiguous results. Furthermore, the MCP instructions haven been augmented for various popular clients:

There is now also the option to pass additional context to any agent to apply consistent rules and information:

The MCP integration can also now be used to manage cisco switches via the new integration:
