This is just a small hotfix update to fix a few important issues:
- Fix license validation throwing errors due to mismatched date format
- Fix .deb installers not being able to resolve some packages on Ubuntu < 22
- Fix command-line installation script on homepage not refreshing package repositories
  on Linux if needed. It also now supports dnf, yum, and zypper as well
