## Terminal docking

On Windows, you can now make use of docked terminal windows right inside the XPipe window. This works for most terminals on Windows. All other terminal integrations are also supported, meaning that you can achieve a pretty impressive combination of tools.

Here is a docked WezTerm instance running the zellij multiplexer through WSL:

Here is a Windows Terminal instance with 4 split tabs that were launched through the split terminal feature of XPipe 20:

A docked terminal is embedded into the XPipe window but can also be detached from it. This gives you full flexibility on how to handle terminal windows. If you want to disable the terminal docking, you can do so in the settings menu.

## Proxmox improvements

- Add full support for Proxmox container networking. They now support services and tunnels in addition to normal VMs
- Add support to open VMs with virt-viewer via SPICE
- The dashboard service now automatically determines whether it actually needs to be tunneled to localhost or not. This improves handling with the HTTPS certificate. Refresh the Proxmox installation entry to apply

## Scripting rework

The scripting system has been completely reworked with the goal of becoming simpler and more powerful at the same time.

- You can now add custom script sources from an external URLs, e.g. a git repository. These source entries can then be used to quickly add script entries to xpipe automatically via an import functionality. It also supports fetching remote script files directory via HTTP urls if needed.

- The script handling for different shell types has been improved. You can now run scripts on a remote system independently of the login shell type as long as the specified shell is installed on the system. This means that you can run for example zsh scripts now on any system with a bash login shell without issues.

- Scripts groups were removed as they didn't provide a lot of value but made the organization more complicated than it needed to be.

## Sync improvements

- Add option to change the sync frequency for the git sync to once per session or fully manual. This can reduce the amount of pushed commits and gives more control on how and when changes are synced
- The git history will now show the actual names of deleted entries instead of just IDs
- Add support to sync to a plain external directory without a git repository
- The git sync can now also work on read-only remote permissions as well
