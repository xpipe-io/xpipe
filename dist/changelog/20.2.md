## Connection creation

The connection creation / configuration dialog has been reworked to allow for a more efficient workflow. When validating a connection, the window is no longer blocked, and you can continue editing the connection or also minimize it meanwhile.

## Command rework

The custom command entries that you can create at `New` -> `Command` have been completely reworked. You can now create runnable commands / scripts to be run in a terminal or in the background without having to depend on creating scripts.

## Remote SSH configs

This update adds back support for SSH configs located on a remote system. You can now add entries from SSH config files by searching for available connections on a remote system. If any host is configured in the config file, it will be added automatically to XPipe.

## Network scan

The network scan has been improved. You can now also explicitly select detected systems even when there was no listening server running on them. Furthermore, the check whether an SSH server is listening has been improved as there were a few false negatives.

## Updated names

The names and location of SSH connections in the creation menu have been updated. There is now no longer a simple SSH connection but instead just an SSH connection.
