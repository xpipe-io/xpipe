## Command rework

The custom command entries that you can create at `New` -> `Command` have been completely reworked. You can now create runnable commands / scripts to be run in a terminal or in the background without having to depend on creating scripts.

## Remote SSH configs

This update adds back support for SSH configs located on a remote system. You can now add entries from the config file by searching for available connections on the remote system.

## Network scan

The network scan has been improved. You can now also explicitly select detected systems even when there was no listening server running on them. Furthermore, the check whether an SSH server is listening it has been improved as there were a few false negatives.

The names and location of SSH connections in the creation menu have been updated. There is now no longer a simple SSH connection but instead just an SSH connection.
