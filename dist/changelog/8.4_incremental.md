## Sudo password improvements

This update will restore the old behavior of sudo passwords being automatically sourced from connection details when possible, e.g. an SSH login password or a set WSL password.
This behavior can also be combined with the option to always confirm elevation access in the security settings if you don't want XPipe to automatically fill in your sudo password.
