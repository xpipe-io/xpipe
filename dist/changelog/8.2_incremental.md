## Quick access for connections

One common feedback that some users shared was that it could be quite cumbersome to access a specific nested connection as one would have to possibly expand several connections first. Expanded connections would then also take up a lot of space, leading to a lot of scrolling.

There is now a quick access button available for connections that enables you to quickly choose a connection in the hierarchy without having to expand any connection views.
