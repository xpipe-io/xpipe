## Git handling improvements

The git error actions have been reworked. In case any merge conflict or similar occurs, the possible actions are now handled better:
- They are properly highlighted to distinguish them from the normal error dialog window
- They now work for all git client localizations
- They are less likely to cause git accidents. Any possible destructive action has to be confirmed now

## Shortcut handling

The file browser has been reworked to support many new keyboard shortcuts and the general using experience has been improved when using a keyboard:

- Files that are right-clicked are now also included in the selection
- The quick access menu will now shift focus properly
- The file list can be navigated with the arrow keys. CTRL and SHIFT can be used to multiple select files
- Any files you drag can now be explicitly moved by holding ALT
- *CTRL+W* closes the current file browser tab
- *CTRL+SHIFT+W* closes all file browser tabs
- *CTRL+Q* closes the window
- *CTRL+F* will now properly toggle the find text field
- *CTRL+L* will now focus the path location text field
- *ALT+HOME* will go to the file system overview page
- *ALT+H* shows the browsing history
- *ALT-UP* navigates to the parent directory
- *ESCAPE* clears the selection
- *SPACE* shows the context menu for the selection
