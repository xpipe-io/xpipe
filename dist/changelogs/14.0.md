## Team vaults + Reusable identities

You can now create reusable identities for connections instead of having to enter authentication information for each connection separately. This will also make it easier to handle any authentication changes later on, as only one config has to be changed.

Furthermore, there is a new encryption mechanism for git vaults, allowing multiple users to have their own private connections and identities in that shared vault by encrypting them with the personal key of the user.

You can combine the reusable identities with the new per-user encryption. Essentially, if you mark a certain identity as being for your user only, it will be encrypted with your personal key and won't be accessible to other team users that have access to the vault without knowing your secret. Any connection that uses this per-user identity, will also be encrypted with your personal secret key, also making them only accessible to you. That way you can control who has access to which connections and login information in your team. You can of course also set identities to be global, so that all team users can utilize them.

If you have previously used a custom vault passphrase to lock your vault, this will be migrated to a user account with that passphrase as its secret. If you have not used that before, you can create your own user in the settings menu. Having multiple vault users requires the Professional plan.

## Incus

- There is now support for incus
- The newly added features for incus have also been ported to the LXD integration

## Window and startup

The application startup routine has been completely redone. The window now shows up quicker and will tell you what it is currently loading. In addition, some dialog windows have been embedded into the main window.

## Git vault

- XPipe will now commit a dummy private key to your repository to make your git provider potentially detect any leaks of your repository contents
- Any keys committed to the repository will now be forced to LF to prevent issues with keys generated on Windows
- XPipe will now explicitly configure the setting `pull.rebase` for the local git repository as having that set to `rebase` globally would break the git sync

## File transfers

- You can now abort an active file transfer. You can find the button for that on the bottom left of the browser status bar
- File transfers where the target write fails due to permissions issues or missing disk space are now better cancelled

## Services

- The custom service creation has been moved to the top level to make it easier to locate
- There is now the option to specify a URL path for services that will be appended when opened in the browser
- Services now show better when they are active or inactive

## Other

- Implement performance improvements for local shells
- The Windows Terminal integration will now create and use its own profile
- There is now a new troubleshooting option to automatically perform a heap dump
- Future updates on Windows will be faster
- There is now the option to censor all displayed contents, allowing for a more simple screensharing workflow for XPipe
- Implement startup speed improvements
- Improve error message for libvirt when user was missing group permissions
- The Yubikey PIV and PKCS#11 SSH auth option have been made more resilient for any PATH issues

## Fixes

- Fix Yubikey PIV and other PKCS#11 SSH libraries not asking for pin on macOS
- Fix connection icon being removed when the connection is edited
- Fix Windows updates breaking pinned shortcuts and some registry keys (This will only work in new updates from now on)
- Fix titlebar on Windows 11 being overlapped in fullscreen mode
- Fix various VNC implementation bugs
- Fix built-in services like the Proxmox dashboard also counting for the service license limit
