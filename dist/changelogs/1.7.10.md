## Changes in 1.7.9

### Git storage rework

The git storage functionality has been in a bad state, hopefully this update will change that.
First of all, several bugs and inconsistencies have been fixed.

Furthermore, the authentication options have been greatly expanded.
You can now supply both HTTP and SSH git URLs. If any input is required like a username/password/passphrase, XPipe will show a prompt.
If you chose to use an SSH git URL, you can also set key-based authentication options just as for other ssh connections.

Lastly, there is now a general data directory as well in which you can put any additional files like SSH keys that you want to include in the repository. You can then refer to them just as normal within XPipe but their file paths are automatically adapted on any system you clone the repository to. You can open this data directory from the settings menu.

It is recommended to start with a remote git repository from scratch though to properly fix previous issues.
