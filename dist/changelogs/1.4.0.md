## Changes in 1.4.0

- Implement support for SSH tunnels / port forwarding.
  This includes local, remote, and dynamic tunneling.
- Rework file browser transfer pane. Files dropped there will no longer be downloaded automatically.
  Instead, you can also use it just to quickly transfer a set of files across file system tabs.
  Only when you now click the new download button, the set of files is downloaded
  to your local machine and can be dragged into your native desktop environment as regular files.
