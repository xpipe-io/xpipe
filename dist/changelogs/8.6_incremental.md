## Education professional licenses

There is now the possibility to use XPipe professional for free for students and faculty from accredited educational institutions (high schools, colleges, and universities). Just send an email to hello@xpipe.io with your official email address of your educational institution.

## Other changes

- Add new quick access context menu for directories in the file browser. This allows you to quickly navigate into a directory structure
- Fix passwords not being properly supplied to some CLI programs like ssh or git if xpipe was started from a terminal. The programs prompted the parent terminal session instead of the xpipe askpass. This is now fixed by calling setsid.
- Fix elevation prompt requiring unnecessary confirmation the first time when the setting to always require elevation confirmation was active
- Fix error messages being wrong when an external application could not be found
- Fix browser transfer progress not showing MBs after more than 1GB had been transferred
- Fix browser file icons sometimes getting mixed up after a change
- Improve file browser display performance
