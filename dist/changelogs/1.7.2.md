# Update procedure

Note that the automatic updater is broken in version 1.6.0. It will freeze the application and not perform the update. **So do not try to click the install button in XPipe**!
You have to install it manually from https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/tag/1.7.3. You can easily do this as uninstalling the old version does not delete any user data. Installing a newer version of XPipe also automatically uninstalls any old ones, so you don't have to manually uninstall it.

## Changes in 1.7.3

- Use newly created macOS app icons that better fit in
- Fix Tabby installation not being detected on Windows if it was system-wide instead of per-user
- Fix some settings values being incorrectly labelled as professional-only
- Fix application restart for license activation not working
- Improve styling in some areas
