## New professional features

- Add ability to open files and directories in VSCode SSH remote environment in file browser
- Added support for fully offline licenses. You can obtain them via email request
  in case you're running it on a system without internet connectivity or restricted proxy settings

## Changes

- Optimize terminal launching performance. When no scripts, environment, or custom title/color are enabled for a connection,
  it will now be instantly launched in a terminal without verifying the connection first.
  This will speed up the process but will move any occurring errors into the terminal window.
  It also fixes any login banners not being shown.
- Make current default shell also show up in shell environments to prevent confusion about missing `bash`
- Improve error messages when an additional password was requested by the connection
  when none was provided instead of just showing permission denied
- Make SSH connection starting from a WSL environment use the native Windows key helper for FIDO2 keys
- Rework insights button for connection creation across the board

- Add ability to debug local background shell in developer options
- Add notice when a professional feature is available in preview mode
