## Shell session caching

A central change in XPipe 13 are the improvements of reusability of shell sessions running in the background. Whenever you access a system or a parent system, XPipe will connect to it just as before but keep this session open in the background for some time, under the assumption that users will typically perform multiple actions afterward. This will improve the speed of many actions and also results in less authentication prompts when you are using something like 2FA.

A common example would be stopping and starting a container. Previously this would have resulted in two connections to the container host system and would have taken a while. Now, there will only be one connection to the host and all actions you perform on that host will be significantly quicker.

## KVM/QEMU/libvirt support

There is now support for KVM/QEMU virtual machines that can be accessed via the libvirt CLI tools `virsh`. This includes support for other driver URLs as well aside from KVM and QEMU.

## File browser

The file browser has been improved:

- There is now a new option in the context menu of a tab to pin it, allowing for having a split view with two different file systems
- There is now the option to dock terminals in the file browser (this is only available on Windows for now)
- The previous system overview tab is now always shown
- There is now a new restart button for containers and VMs

## Security updates

There's now a new mechanism in place for checking for security updates separately from the normal update check. This is important going forward, to be able to act quickly when any security patch is published, so that all users have the possibility to get notified even if they don't follow announcements on the GitHub repo or on Discord. You can also disable this functionality if you want.

- The application style has been reworked
- The settings menu now shows a restart button when a setting has been change that requires a restart to apply
