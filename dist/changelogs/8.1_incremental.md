## Windows updater issues

The last few versions of XPipe from 1.7.16 to 8.0.1 all had a self-updater on Windows that was not working properly. This was caused by a newly introduced JDK bug. This is now fixed from 8.1 onwards.

To upgrade to 8.1+, you have to do it manually by downloading and installing it from https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases. There shouldn't be any more problems with 8.1+ after that.

This also fixes opened terminal windows closing down when XPipe is closed on Windows. They will now stay open.

## Git Vault Versioning

When upgrading XPipe versions across many systems, one problem could have been the git vault format being updated on one system and being pulled on another a system that is running an older version. This could have led to data corruption. From now on, there will be a warning shown when the versions do not match up. From there you can choose to temporarily disable the git vault during a session until you upgrade to the matching version on that system as well.

If this problem already happened to you, you should be able to reset the git repository to a previous ref.

## Filtering for hosts

You can now search for IPs and hostnames in addition to the connection names to filter your connection list. The connection a display when a filter is active has also been improved.

## File browser transfer fixes

There was a regression in transfer speed in 8.0 causing transfers of large files being very slow. This is now fixed.

There had been a chance of files being corrupted when being transferred on Windows systems when there was a BOM included due to cmd overstepping its responsibilities and altering some data. This is now fixed.

## Open directories in WSL

There is now a new action available in the file browser for directories on Windows systems that allows you to open that directory in a WSL session. This makes it easier to quickly use Linux tools in a certain directory you're currently in when on Windows.
