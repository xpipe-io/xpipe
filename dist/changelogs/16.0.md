## Docker

This release introduces support for docker compose. Containers in compose projects are grouped together and can be managed all at the same time via the compose project entry.

The container state information shown is also improved, always showing the container state in combination with the system information.

## Batch mode

There is now a batch mode available which allows you to select multiple systems via checkboxes and perform actions for the entire batch. This can include starting/stopping, automatically adding available subconnections, or running scripts on all systems.

You can toggle the batch mode in the top left corner.

## Terminals

There is now built-in support for the terminal multiplexers tmux, zellij, and screen.

There is also now support for custom prompts with starship, oh-my-posh, and oh-my-zsh.

You can now run custom init commands for the terminal session to configure the terminal appearance specific to XPipe.

On Windows, you now have the ability to use a WSL or Cygwin environment as the terminal environment, allowing you to use the new terminal multiplexer integration seamlessly on Windows as well.

- There is now support for KeePassXC
