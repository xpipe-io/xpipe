## SSH

The support for FIDO2 SSH keys on Linux and macOS has been improved:
- PINs are now cached by default so they only have to be entered once. Caching can be disabled in the security settings
- User presence confirmation requests are now shown with an icon notification in XPipe
- The integration has been fixed to no longer spam many password windows
- Fix FIDO2 keys not working with xpipe if they were already added to the SSH agent

Furthermore, the shell profile loading on Linux has been reworked with the goal of better handling the SSH agent detection.
