- This release fixes an issue on macOS where XPipe defaulted to sh instead of zsh.
  There seems to be some bugs in macOS 15 where the spawning of external programs fails sometimes,
  leading XPipe to believe that zsh does not work correctly.
  XPipe will now no longer fall back to sh and instead fail to start,
  with the hope that on the next start the process spawning issue won't occur again.
- Fix macOS window getting smaller on each successive launch
- Fix tooltip dropshadows not working in webtop
- Fix XPipe not being in taskbar by default in webtop
- Fix file browser transfer progress being wrong for files < 1kb
- Show proper error when a source file gets deleted while a transfer is in progress
- Fix empty storage directory setting leading to startup crash
- Fix update script reporting syntax error on zsh
- Fix NullPointers when a script had no commands on its own
