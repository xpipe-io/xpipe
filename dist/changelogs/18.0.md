Note: You should not use this build for any kind of normal use yet. It is mostly for internal testing. Once the PTB branch is stable enough for normal usage, this note will be removed.

## Hetzner cloud

This release introduces support for Hetzner cloud servers via the hcloud CLI tool. You can list all your service automatically and then just access them normally as SSH connections.

## Host addresses

You can now configure multiple addresses for a host. This allows you to quickly switch between different addresses if needed.

## Other

- Add support for SSH agent authentication methods to specify a fixed public key so that only a certain private key will be offered by the agent. This prevents cases in which the authentication fails because the agent tried too many keys.
- Add more documentation links to the settings menu
- Improve vscode launch menu to be more compact
- Add support to launch VsCode Insiders and Trae as well in the vscode launch menu
- Add workaround for script execution issues on systems where tmp is mounted with noexec


## Fixes

- Fix exception when VNC connection required username but identity didn't provide one
- Fix tunnel restart sometimes resulting in an invalid tunnel state
