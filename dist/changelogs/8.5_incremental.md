## Professional edition restructuring

There was some feedback that the available plans for the professional edition were confusing. The monthly subscription and one time purchase could easily be confused as basically the same thing with a different timespan. Even the FAQ could still not eliminate all points of confusion as most readers were already familiar with plans from other tools, so it was difficult to properly break up the terms.

While the monthly subscription did serve well as a cheap trial of some sorts, the community edition does almost the same job as most functionality is also available in there for noncommercial systems. Most people were also wary of subscriptions and interpreted the one-time purchase option as just a longer subscription even though that is not the case.

With this update, the monthly subscription will be retired. This makes it much easier to explain what you will get when purchasing the professional edition without having to differentiate between two completely different models. If you are currently using the monthly subscription, nothing will change for you. It will just not be possible for new customers to purchase it anymore.

The website at [https://xpipe.io](https://xpipe.io) has also been updated with the updated professional edition structure and will now hopefully explain everything better.
