## Compose

Several docker management platforms like portainer restrict external control of their compose projects. Instead of throwing confusing error messages, XPipe now detects if a compose project is managed by an external tool like portainer and displays this state for the compose project and prevents these external modifications. This also fixes cases where some compose projects were not listed by XPipe.
