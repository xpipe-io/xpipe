## Changes

- You can now add SSH connections from arbitrary OpenSSH config files under `Add remote host` -> `SSH Config`
- The SSH config importer now supports include statements. Included files are automatically resolved and joined
- Add experimental ability to automatically fix SSH key file permissions on Windows if OpenSSH complains
- Rework file browser connection history overview to always update when you close a tab
- The Linux installers now correctly report their dependencies. This was not really a problem on any
  normal desktop system, but should make it easier to run on embedded systems or in WSL2g
- Improve performance mode speedup by removing more styling. You can enable the mode under Settings -> Appearance
- Change layout of connection names and status to better handle very long connection names across all window sizes
- Make any connection quickly renameable in the edit window without verifying whether we can actually connect
- Allow for creation of multiple connections with the same name
- Add a self test functionality on startup to handle cases where the local shell could not be initialized correctly
- Implement fallback to bundled fonts on Linux systems that do not have fontconfig
- Create repository for nixos releases at https://github.com/xpipe-io/nixpkg
- Improve documentation for custom terminal command setting
